Data Description:
    1. Statewise yearly accidents (from 2006 to 2016) in India due to alcohol intake or drug intake.
    2. Statewise yearly accidents (from 2008 to 2016) in India due to Exceeding Lawful Speed by drivers.
    
Plot Details:
  For years 2014, 2015 and 2016, a scatter plot b/w "number of road accidents due to alcohol.drug consumption" and "number of accidents due to Exceeding Lawful Speed by drivers" is made, where each scatter point corresponds to a state. This plot is made to visually analyse if there exists a corelation b/w these two causes of road accidents.
  
Observations:
  There is no corelation between the road accidents due to alcohol/drug consumption and the road accidents due to overspeeding.
